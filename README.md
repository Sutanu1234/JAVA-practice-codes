<h3> Page 4 : contain Some LeetCode prob and Sol</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Two Sum using hash map (* Time Complexity: O(n)    *Space Complexity: O(min(n, m)), n: length of array and m: number of elements needed to reach the target.)</li>
  
  <li>AdjacencyMatrix {(getNeighbors), (isConnected), (dfs), (etDegree), (isCyclic), (isCyclicUtil)}</li>
  
  <li>Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

  The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).</li>
  
<li>Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1: Input: x = 123, Output: 321   
Example 2: Input: x = -123, Output: -321   
Example 3: Input: x = 120, Output: 21

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.</li>

<li>Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
  
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]<br>
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]<br>
Explanation: <br>
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.<br>
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.<br>
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.<br>
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].<br>
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.</li>

<li>You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:  Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]<br>
Example 2:  Input: lists = [] Output: []</li>

<li>Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

 Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5]
 Output: Intersected at '8'</li>
</ul>
